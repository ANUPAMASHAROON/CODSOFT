CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED
 RESPONSES
 Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
 predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
 techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
 responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
 language processing and conversation flow.
